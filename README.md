# CodeTuner

It takes some inputs and replaces or surrounds them with the desired characters.
Each profile has its own sets of replacements that need to be made.

## Inspired by ðŸ¤¡ CHAOS CHAOS ðŸ¤¡ During Giving Season!
Our queues were swamped during Q4, and the errors were EXTREMELY repetitive and fairly predictable. Busy work! Menial Tasks! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS! LET'S SPEND MORE TIME AUTOMATING THE PROBLEM AWAY THAN WE WILL EVER SPEND ACTUALLY DOING THOSE TASKS <sup>as a result of the automation and despite not ever making something like this beforeeeee WOOOOOOOOO</sup>! 

> (Except in this case, it was actually totally worth it. It cut down production time for this particular client into a FIFTH (1/5) of what it was before. Yayyyyyy!)

Check out an example of it **[here via CodePen](www.google.com)**!

## ðŸ”– What I've done and what I'm learning

I'm using libraries I'm comfortable with but also want to learn new CMS' and HTML preprocessors.

- I'm way more comfortable settings up the directory structure for new projects!
- Only dabbled in React from using Sanity.io for my website. Only dabbled in Nuxt for 5 seconds one time. --> Commit to using Svelte/SvelteKit to recreate at least ONE Client Helper I previously made in CodePen.
- I need to replace strings in a less putrid way --> Knock knock it's RegEx
- Don't really have time to make a full app, or time to plan out the UI. --> Let's make sure it at least doesn't cause someone to instantly combust on sight. (And learn how stacking components' styles on top of each other actually behaves on delivery, I guess.)

## Goal + Plans

I've never worked with a framework of this sort before, and had no familiarity with SPAs. Two birds, one stone: I needed something to help get rid of the repetitive edits I no longer wanted to do, and I wanted to learn how to make something that can do things! Ta-da!

While I don't think I'm going to keep working on this, its local build genuinely helps me day-to-day during a contract job! MVPs amirite?
