# CodeTuner

It takes some inputs and replaces or surrounds them with the desired characters.
Each profile has its own sets of replacements that need to be made.

## ðŸ”– What I've done and what I'm learning

I'm using libraries I'm comfortable with but also want to learn new CMS' and HTML preprocessors.

- I'm way more comfortable settings up the directory structure for new projects!
- Only dabbled in React from using Sanity.io for my website. Only dabbled in Nuxt for 5 seconds one time. --> Commit to using Svelte/SvelteKit to recreate at least ONE Client Helper I previously made in CodePen.
- I need to replace strings in a less putrid way --> Knock knock it's RegEx
- Don't really have time to make a full app, or time to plan out the UI. --> Let's make sure it at least doesn't cause someone to instantly combust on sight. (And learn how stacking components' styles on top of each other actually behaves on delivery, I guess.)

## Goal + Plans

I've never worked with a framework of this sort before, and had no familiarity with SPAs. Two birds, one stone: I needed something to help get rid of the repetitive edits I no longer wanted to do, and I wanted to learn how to make something that can do things! Ta-da!

While I don't think I'm going to keep working on this, its local build genuinely helps me day-to-day during a contract job! MVPs amirite?
